How To Make AI Videos

A comprehensive guide featuring step by step instructions on how to make AI videos.

I show EVERYTHING, including how I generate images, animate motion, write dialogue, synthesize voices, choose music, write jokes, etc.

You can apply this process to more than just comedy videos. This technology is in its infancy and I'll show you exactly what I'm doing, and the tools I'm using.

Behind The Scenes

I deep dive into all of my videos and show you how I thought of and developed concepts like the "Chevy Goliath", "Poo Detective" and "Juan Chalupa".

Tutorial videos where I make new Turbodong videos from SCRATCH so you can see exactly what I'm doing from the inception to the completion of a video.

How to make fart songs like my cover of "Enter Fartman", "Blinding Farts" and Beethoven's "Fart Elise".

Full Communication & Transparency

I will answer every comment/question on this Patreon with urgency and sincerity as well as take requests for any kind of video explanation.

Whether you're a beginner or have experience with AI, I will treat you equally and try to help you develop your craft.

I will be posting 4 - 7 times a week on this Patreon.
