"If you're interested in making your own AI videos, I just started a Patreon where I'll be showing you EXACTLY how I make them. I show EVERYTHING, including how I generate images, animate motion, write dialogue, synthesize voices, choose music, write jokes, etc. If you have some time to learn, I really believe anyone can do this. Feel free to check it out: patreon.com/turbodong2000"
